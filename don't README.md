Simple Nightcord at 25 themed paint program on python...

Just an average grade 11's first written program

It's not very good, and the codes aren't efficient or anything



I believe python is required to run it..

The steps I believe are

1. Download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Go to cmd prompt, copy-paste "pip install pygame", without the quotation marks

3. You can either download the main.exe file, and simply run it, or to run the original code, download both main.py and the img folder, make sure they're in the same directory, and run the code from there

If it doesn't work, you can also try to run it online through replit:

Thank you for taking interest in my project \:kohanebow\:

Edit(A few points)\:
1. main.exe will likely not be updated in line with the code main.py. Therefore it would be recommended to run the program through the code instead.
2. I realize using classes and other functions may be more efficient/clean, unfortunately I have not learned that function when I made this, and regretfully therefore I realize I may not have used the most effective codes(sorry if it's laggy)
3. I do not plan to edit/revise this, at least likely not anytime soon. It was for a marked assignment to submit, and now that it is over I do not think I would even open it again.. (sorry)
4. I received many suggestions, and most likely will not be implementing them. Too much work
   I would maybe downscale the canvas if possible, but I do not know how to do so in an effective way, without having to change all the numbers individually
   neither do I know how to make "adjustable" windows
(Sorry if I seem very "uneager-to-learn",, I appreciate all the advice but really have no energy to modify any further..)
